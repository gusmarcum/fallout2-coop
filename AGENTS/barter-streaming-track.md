## ►► ACTIVE track — barter streaming to the viewer

Barter is the trade/inventory sub-modal reachable from dialog when talking to a
merchant NPC. Plan of record = `BARTER_STREAMING_PLAN.md (deleted)` (repo root, JUST CREATED).
Read it FIRST for architecture + staged decomposition.

**Key fact**: Server-side barter engine is largely DONE — `inventoryOpenTrade` already
has a full `serverLoopActive()` drain loop processing OFFER/TAKE/UNOFFER/COMMIT/DONE
intents from the `barter_intent` queue. The gap is the viewer side.

**Resume ladder** (see BARTER_STREAMING_PLAN.md (deleted) for detail):
- **B0** — Enter `inventoryOpenTrade` on viewer (~1 session)
- **B1** — Table object netIds + inventory streaming (~1-2 sessions, the real work)
- **B2** — Wire verbs: boffer/btake/bunoffer/bcommit through serverControlLine (~1 session)
- **B3** — Modal integration: kBarter in kViewerModalMask, matching teardown (~1 session)

**Estimated**: 3-4 sessions total. Much smaller than dialog was — no engine relocation,
no symbol collisions.

### Current state (viewer sees static barter window)
- `gameDialogTicker` processes mode 2→3 → calls `_gdialog_barter_create_win()` which
  shows barter window with Talk/Offer buttons
- 'T' key → `_barter_end_to_talk_to()` wired (returns to dialog)
- `kBarter` (0x20000) exists in GameMode, NOT yet in kViewerModalMask
- `inventoryOpenTrade` (the interactive trade screen) is NEVER entered on viewer

### Fresh-session bootstrap
1. Read `BARTER_STREAMING_PLAN.md (deleted)` (repo root)
2. Read [[p5-server-plan]] for RESUME PROTOCOL + gate/live-demo commands
3. Read `src/inventory_ui.cc:4481` (`inventoryOpenTrade`) for existing server drain
4. Read `src/game_dialog.cc:2029-2057` for server barter branch in `_gdProcess`
5. Read `src/barter_intent.{h,cc}` for the intent queue (already exists)
6. Gate = `scripts/check.sh` → must pass "ALL GATES PASS"

### Predecessor
[[dialog-streaming-track]] (DONE — A0→A3 completed, dialog now renders on viewer)
