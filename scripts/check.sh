# All-in-one verify gate: build + golden replay suite.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check.sh              # build (linux + windows), then all golden cases
#   scripts/check.sh --build-only # just the builds
#
# Exits nonzero on build error or any golden FAIL. Build warnings are
# suppressed (pre-existing upstream noise); errors always shown.
#
# BUILD TYPES — both trees carry DEBUG SYMBOLS on purpose. This is a WIP engine;
# a crash must give a usable core/backtrace without a rebuild-to-reproduce round
# trip. Linux is RelWithDebInfo rather than Debug because the golden runners
# impose hard wall-clock timeouts (as tight as `timeout -k 3 25`) that an -O0
# build would blow, turning a slow build into spurious FAILs. Windows has no
# gate timing to break, so it is full Debug.

# so a stream that got an object's proto, art frame, flags, hp or inventory wrong sailed
# through a green suite and was found later by a human clicking something in a live
