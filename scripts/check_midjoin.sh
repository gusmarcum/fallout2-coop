# MID-STREAM JOIN gate (STEP 5). A second SDL-dummy viewer connects to a live,
# already-streaming server; PASS requires the joiner's baseline tripwire to
# score clean (ok>0 bad=0 — every SNAPSHOT_OBJECT matches its blob-loaded world,
# i.e. the join-time netId re-walk aligned) and the first viewer to survive the
# rebaseline broadcast (world reload) without dropping.
#
# Oracle notes: the tripwire line is debugPrint'd by the JOINER only (viewer A
# runs without DEBUGACTIVE — two processes share FO2/debug.log and the later
# boot truncates it). Viewer A's health is asserted via the server's stderr
# (joined line present, no drop before teardown) and its live PID.
