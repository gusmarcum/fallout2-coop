# Gate 9: resumable server combat (P5-C / P2). Boots the f2_server on the aggro
# fixture map (klatoxcv) with the resumable-combat session gate ON, drives a real
# fight over the wire + debug CMD port, and asserts the four properties that are
# impossible without the beat-spanning session machine (see tools/resumable_probe.py).
set -u
# ►► RUNS THE DEFAULT SERVER CONFIG — features ON, nothing disabled. It asserts that a
# mid-fight cattack resolves as a dude attack, and the probe accepts EITHER channel that can
# carry one: EVENT_ATTACK_RESULT, or EVENT_PRES_SEQ when the record channel is presenting it
# (combat.cc:6019 suppresses the former for a recorded attack ON PURPOSE, to stop the viewer
# double-presenting). Asserting only on ATTACK_RESULT is what made this gate look red whenever
# recording was on — see tools/resumable_probe.py.
