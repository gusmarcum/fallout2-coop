# P3 LIVE COMBAT DEMO — the first human-driven, turn-based fight over the network.
# Runs f2_server with the RESUMABLE-COMBAT session gate on (fights span beats,
# combat.cc) and streams the wire to real SDL viewers. Drive the dude's combat
# turn from the controlling viewer window:
#
#   left-click  = combat move to a tile   (cmove — AP-limited)
#   A           = attack nearest hostile  (cattack)
#   E / Enter   = end your turn           (cendturn)
#
# The viewer prints "YOUR TURN ap=N" to FO2/debug.log (DEBUGACTIVE=log) when the
# dude's turn opens; the server waits on the connected claimant — up to
# F2_SERVER_TURN_IDLE_MS of think time per action before it auto-ends the turn.
#
# MODES:
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh server    # boot ONLY the server (headless), stays up
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh client    # connect ONE viewer to a running server
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh           # all-in-one: server + one viewer (+SPECTATORS)
#
# The split modes let you control each process independently — e.g. run the server
# and first client in the background, then connect/close/reconnect a second client:
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh server &        # headless server
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh client &        # client 1 (controller — connects first)
#   scripts/combat_demo.sh client          # client 2 (spectator; Ctrl-C to drop,
#                                          #           rerun to reconnect)
# The FIRST viewer to connect wins the control claim; later viewers spectate
# (their claim is refused, input dropped). Each client gets its own join-blob
# scratch file, so concurrent viewers never clobber each other.
#
# Once a viewer is up, START the fight from another shell:
#   printf 'aggro 1\n' | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201
#
# SPECTATORS=N (all-in-one mode only) launches N extra watch-only viewers next to
# the controller, all windowed, joining BEFORE you aggro so combat opens clean.
#
# Env: MAP, WIRE_PORT, CMD_PORT, HOST, PACE (ms/beat; 100 = real time), IDLE_MS
# (per-action think budget, default 60s), SPECTATORS (all-in-one only, default 0).
