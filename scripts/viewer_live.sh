# STEP-4 live viewer demo (CLIENT_JOIN_DESIGN.md). Boots f2_server on a map,
# streams the binary wire over TCP, and launches the real SDL client as a
# read-only viewer that joins + renders the world live. A dedicated command
# channel lets you poke the running sim and watch the effect in the viewer.
#
#   scripts/viewer_live.sh                 # artemple, default ports
#   MAP=kladwtwn.map scripts/viewer_live.sh
#   LOAD=8 scripts/viewer_live.sh          # restore save slot 8 instead of a map
#
# Then, from another shell, inject commands (same "verb arg arg2" vocabulary as
# the probe's F2_PROBE_ACTIONS / commandDispatch):
#   printf 'give 41 1\ndrop 41\n' | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201   # drop an item at the dude's feet
#   printf 'aggro 1\n'            | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201   # start combat (synchronous; may end the map)
#   printf 'walk 40\n'            | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201   # dude WALKS +40 tiles, one tile per beat (arg2=1 runs)
#   printf 'critwalk -30 1\n'     | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201   # nearest critter runs -30 tiles
#   printf 'walkto 22150\n'       | nc -q1 127.0.0.1 9201   # dude walks to an absolute tile
#
# Env: MAP, WIRE_PORT, CMD_PORT, PACE (ms/beat; 0 = full speed, ~10ms/beat is
# roughly real time — the server is logical-time-only, this is a demo throttle).
# F2_SERVER_SMOOTH_WALK=1 (set below) makes out-of-combat walks — script-driven
# wanderers and the walk/walkto verbs — step one tile per beat instead of
# applying the whole path in one frame, so the viewer sees motion animate.
# VIEWERS=N (STEP 5): launch N viewers; extras join MID-STREAM, staggered 5s
# apart, all windowed (F2_WINDOWED=1) so they fit side by side to eyeball sync.
#
# NAMES="Zorbax,Quixle": give each viewer its own ACCOUNT NAME, so viewer i logs
# in as the i-th name and the server binds it to that name's character
# (ACCOUNT_IDENTITY_DESIGN.md). Unset = every viewer sends the legacy bare
# `claim`, i.e. exactly today's behaviour.
#   CREATE0=.. CREATE1=..: optional "S P E C I A L [tag tag tag] [trait trait]"
#   for the matching name, used only the FIRST time that name is seen. Also
#   accepts "ask" — roll the character in vanilla's own creation screen.
#
# ►► CREATE<n> IS 0-BASED, and it lines up with the VIEWER index, not necessarily
# with the slot. CREATE0 is the first viewer, not CREATE1.
#
# Slots are handed out on a FIRST-COME basis, and with an interactive CREATE<n>=ask
# that means whoever finishes rolling first takes slot 0 — the host body, which the
# remaining host-only screen (dialog) is gated on. Worldmap travel and map
# transitions are open to every player as of 2026-07-23. HOST=<name> pins slot 0 to
# that account instead, so "who is the host" stops being a race:
#   HOST=Cahb NAMES="Cahb,Mennoc" CREATE0=ask CREATE1=ask VIEWERS=2 ...
#
# Example — two players, each their own character, no player count anywhere:
#   NAMES="Zorbax,Quixle" CREATE0="10 1 10 1 1 1 1 0 1 2" \
#   CREATE1="1 10 1 1 10 1 1 3 4 5" VIEWERS=2 scripts/viewer_live.sh
set -u

# The i-th entry of NAMES, or empty. Takes a 0-based index; cut is 1-based.

    printf '%s' "${NAMES:-}" | cut -d, -f"$(( $1 + 1 ))"
