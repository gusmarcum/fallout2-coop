// tables are pid==-1 scratch objects that never emit a SPAWN (object.cc

// and they are destroyed with the trade. The wire therefore carries a SNAPSHOT of

// mirrors carry netId 0 and are never indexed by the net map — they exist only to
// give the vanilla trade window something to draw.

// objects the vanilla drag gesture and quantity dial hold pointers into for their
// whole run: a use-after-free. So onState only LATCHES the snapshot rows and onEnd
// only LATCHES "ended"; the actual object churn happens here, at points the caller
// guarantees are safe:
//   * clientBarterApplyPending(): rebuild the mirror tables from the latched
//     snapshot. Called at the TOP of the trade loop, with no move-helper on the
//     stack. No-op if nothing is pending.

//     from the MAIN loop once the trade window has already closed.
