// applies the live F2NS event stream, mutating the local sim into the server's
// reconstructed state. It runs INSIDE the client binary (headless probe or the
// real SDL viewer), so it has the full sim to mutate. The frame/event walker is
// source-agnostic: it consumes bytes from a file (S2) or a socket (S3) through
// the same IncrementalStream.

// S2 file-sourced consumer: reads a captured F2NS wire stream from `path`, loads
// the join snapshot, applies the live stream, and leaves the sim in the
// reconstructed state (ready for a state_dump). `blobTmpPath` is scratch used to
// reassemble the blob before mapLoad. Returns false on a framing error, a
// blob-guard mismatch, or a load failure.

// of these: it pump()s each frame and render()s. Socket transport is POSIX-only
// (mirrors server_net.cc); on Windows connect() fails and the viewer is
// unsupported (the game itself is unaffected).
// Set by mainClientViewer for the process lifetime. The §E design doc reserves
// this as the viewer's backstop flag; today it gates focus behavior — a viewer
// must keep pumping and rendering while UNFOCUSED (inputGetInput's
