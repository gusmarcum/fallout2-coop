// One owner for all viewer-side presentation of authoritative wire state
// (PRESENTATION_FSM_DESIGN.md). Merges the three former registries into a single
// module — this is step 2 "co-location" of that plan (the entry fusion + FSM state
// model is a separate follow-up; today the three concerns still live in three
// internal containers, but behind one lifecycle):
//
//   • GLIDE   (was client_anim / gWalks): plays a walk/run cycle and glides the
//             sprite between tiles for each authoritative MOVE hop instead of
//             snapping. Owns fid/frame/rotation and the between-tile pixel offset;
//             it also lags obj->tile behind authority mid-glide (present-tile
//             rebucketing, #6/#9) and reconciles at drain/cancel/stand-down.
//   • REPLAY  (was client_combat_anim / gDeferred): replays the vanilla attack /
//             take-out choreography via _action_attack + reg_anim, and HOLDS a
//             participant's final fid/flags/rotation until the replay completes
//             (deferred-final-state).
//   • DOOR    (was client_door_anim / gDoors): replays the vanilla door open/close
//             frame slide so doors don't snap and crossers don't warp through.
//
// The load-bearing invariant is unchanged: sim state (obj->tile/elevation, hp/ap,
// inventory) is ALWAYS the wire's latest authoritative value, applied at decode;
// this module only paces the PIXELS (MP_PROTOCOL.md §1: behind = snap forward,
// never replay). Off by default; only mainClientViewer enables it (presSetEnabled),
// so the headless joining client and every golden gate stay byte-identical.

// -- lifecycle (viewer-only) --------------------------------------------------
// Enable/disable the whole presentation layer. Disabling drops every in-flight
// glide/replay/door WITHOUT retracting (used at viewer shutdown).
void presSetEnabled(bool enabled);
// Discard-all: the object list itself is being replaced (map transition / new join
// blob). Ends any in-flight reg_anim sequence (one animationStop) before the old
// objects are freed, then drops all bookkeeping unapplied — the incoming baseline
// defines the new truth.
void presReset();
// Stand every in-flight glide down (retract offset + restore stand fid/frame at the
// authoritative tile) then drop them. For combat ENTER, so a mid-run critter doesn't
// freeze wearing its running fid. Replays/doors are untouched (combat can't overlap
// one on enter today).
void presStandDownAll();
// An object is being destroyed/disconnected: drop its glide and end any replay
// reg_anim that still points at it (snapping surviving participants to their held
// final state) before it is freed. Doors are never per-object-forgotten (they are
// not destroyed mid-presentation). Safe when obj has no presentation.
void presForgetObject(Object* obj);

// End only obj's WALK GLIDE, leaving any in-flight replay (and the object itself)
// alone. For a critter that DIES mid-walk: presForgetObject is too big a hammer
// there — it also cancels the reg_anim batch, which is the death animation we want
// to watch — while doing nothing leaves the walk glide alive on the corpse, where it
// keeps re-asserting its sub-tile offset over the death animation (visible in
// F2_TRACE_EVENTS as repeated "[walk] OFFSET-FOREIGN" on a dead netId).
//
// That matters beyond cosmetics: the offset moves the SPRITE without moving
// obj->tile, so the body is drawn up to a tile away from where every tile-based
// check says it is. A player walks to where the corpse looks, and the server
// refuses the loot as "not adjacent" — the exact desync the owner hit.
void presEndGlideFor(Object* obj);
// Per-frame advance, called once from the viewer render loop AFTER the presentation
// pump (client_net presentationTick). Steps glides, then the reg_anim sequences
// (_object_animate), then reaps completed replays, then reaps completed door slides
// — this ordering is load-bearing (glide runs before foreign reg_anim writes land).
void presAdvance();

// -- glide (GLIDE) ------------------------------------------------------------
// Decoder hook, called AFTER the authoritative objectSetLocation of a MOVE.
// durMs > 0 is the animate-vs-snap discriminator (MP_PROTOCOL.md §2): stepped
// walk/run hops stamp sim-ms-per-tile; teleports/scripted placements carry 0.
// hold=true queues the hop's glide WITHOUT starting it (combat sequencing, §3.d):
// the sprite parks at the origin until a matching clientAnimRelease, so a future
// turn's approach cannot glide ahead of its own TURN_START.
// `run` is AUTHORITATIVE, off the wire (EVENT_MOVE). Do not re-derive it from
// durMs — that made the animation a function of server load. See
// presenter_network.h presenterSetNextMoveRun.
