// Headless/authoritative combat drivers, split out of the f2_client combat_ui.cc
// (REWRITE_PLAN P5 cut-list head H3). combat_ui.cc is NOT linked into f2_server,
// so its serverLoopActive() combat bodies were dead there and core combat.cc's
// by-name calls into them (_combat_turn_run/_combat_input/_combat_display/
// _combat_outline_on/off/calledShotSelectHitLocation) resolved to abort stubs.
//
// This TU (f2_core, SDL-free) now OWNS those entry points with the branch that
// the server needs:
//   - _combat_turn_run / _combat_input: the serverLoopActive() headless driver
//     inline; the interactive frame-pump / keyboard loop delegates to the
//     combat*Client() helpers in combat_ui.cc (f2_client — stubbed & never
//     reached on the server, which always takes the headless branch).
//   - _combat_display: pure narration (messageList + presenter()->consoleMessage),
//     already SDL-free, moved WHOLE with its static helpers and hitLocationGetName
//     (the last is still used by the called-shot chrome in combat_ui.cc, so it is
//     no longer static — declared in combat_ui.h).
//   - _combat_outline_on/off: pure critter-highlight presentation, moved whole
//     with a serverLoopActive() no-op guard (headless has no world view; the only
//     client symbols they name — gameMouseGetMode/tileWindowRefresh — were already
//     stubs).
//   - calledShotSelectHitLocation: a thin dispatcher — the server never reaches the
//     modal picker (the intent driver passes an explicit hit location to
//     _combat_attack), so it returns -1 headless; the client modal lives in
//     combat_ui.cc as calledShotSelectHitLocationClient.
//
// The probe (client binary) still exercises the headless branch here, now core-
// located, so the golden event/replay streams are unchanged.
