// scripts branch on it (the gmovie_played opcode via scripts.cc), proto.cc and
// worldmap.cc gate the vault-suit content on it, and it round-trips through the
// savegame. So f2_core owns the array and its accessors; game_movie.cc keeps
// the SDL playback pipeline (windows/palette/subtitles/sound) that marks it.
//

// instead of the old blanket `return false` stub — that lie would have silently
// mis-branched any script asking whether a movie had played.
