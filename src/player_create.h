// The spec a client supplies to say "this is who I am" instead of joining as a
// copy of the host. Deliberately DATA, not a screen: the creation UI (whenever it
// exists) only has to fill this in, and the headless/scripted path fills the same
// struct — so both go through one applier and one validation point.
//
// Owner ruling: creation is an EXPLICIT CLIENT INTENT and never a default. A
// login with no spec keeps today's behaviour (a clone of the host), which is what
// keeps the premade/golden path unchanged.

// the HOST so the non-sheet parts of the row (fid, messageId, flags, AI packet)
// are right, and without the reset a created character would silently inherit the
// host's perks and skill investment.
