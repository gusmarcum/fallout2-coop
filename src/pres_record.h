// Presentation record/replay — the POC seam (PRESENTATION_RECORD_REPLAY_SPEC.md).
//
// The dedicated server runs the engine's animate branch it normally SKIPS (the
// !serverLoopActive() gate) inside a record section; the animationRegister* LEAVES,
// instead of no-op'ing (server_anim.cc), append a typed command to a flat buffer.
// The buffer ships as EVENT_PRES_SEQ; the viewer replays it through its OWN real
// reg_anim engine (client_net.cc presPlayRecordedSeq) — vanilla-faithful by
// construction, no per-action replay function. This proves the theory on the
// explosion; actionExplodeReplay is the debt it would eventually delete.
//
// Everything here is a no-op unless F2_SERVER_PRES_RECORD is set AND a record
// section is open — so goldens stay byte-identical (the server keeps emitting the
// old EVENT_EXPLOSION_FX cue).

// for widening it to every animation family. Read this before touching the .cc.
//
// KEY REFRAME (why this is smaller than it looks): the leaf VOCABULARY below is
// already ~complete — every animationRegister* leaf in server_anim.cc already has
// a record op + emitter (Table A, spec §4.1). Widening coverage is therefore NOT
// "invent N opcodes per family"; it is three bounded kinds of work:
//   (W1) a few more CALLBACK TAGS  (this file — PresCallbackTag; spec Table B)
//   (W2) relax the serverLoopActive() GATE at each composite SITE so its animate
//        branch runs under a record section (actions.cc / combat.cc /
//        proto_instance.cc — NOT this file; see the FAMILY TABLE for the sites)
//   (W3) clear per-family HAZARDS (register-time state mutation; throw branch).
//
// FAMILY TABLE — what each migration step folds in, and the bespoke quirk it
// RETIRES (spec §8). Status: [POC]=done in the POC, [ ]=scope, [KEEP]=stays as-is.

// ►► Bucket C landed WITHOUT a dedicated opcode stream, and the reason generalises: the record
//    hooks sit on the animationRegister* LEAVES in server_anim.cc (e.g. :1048 presRecordAnimate
//    inside animationRegisterAnimate), not on the opcodes. A script opcode is just another caller
//    of the same leaf, so it records by RUNNING — op_reg_anim_animate/_reverse/_forever/_play_sfx
//    and op_animate_stand[_reverse] (reg_anim_begin + leaf + reg_anim_end) are covered with no
//    per-opcode work.
//    ⚠ DO NOT audit presentation coverage by reading opcode BODIES — they look untapped; the
//    wiring is one call down. Of the 24 PURE-UI opcodes in docs/SCRIPT_OPCODE_MAP.md the only
//    genuinely unwired one is op_game_ui_disable/_enable (0x8133/0x8134), which is not an anim and
//    so wants a presenter() virtual mirroring screenFadeOut, not this channel.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// TARGET ARCHITECTURE — the recorder is the SINGLE presentation engine for every
// DISCRETE action; the ONLY non-authoritative presentation is real-time free-roam
// locomotion glide.
//
// A "discrete action" (attack, open door, loot, use-item-on, skill-on-target,
// weapon switch, gesture, death) is ALWAYS a server-authored recorded sequence the
// client replays through its real reg_anim. Two entry gates, ONE replay engine:
//   - IN COMBAT: turn-serial. The barrier already paces it; one actor at a time,
//     no simultaneity → locomotion folds INTO the sequence here too (the combat
//     move is recorded like any other leaf; end tile is authoritative).
//   - OUT OF COMBAT: gated by the approach-latch (PendingInteraction), lifecycle:
//
//        free-roam GLIDE (soft, non-authoritative, real-time, interruptible)
//              │  server walks you adjacent (existing latch)
//              ▼
//        ARRIVAL → server fires the action:
//              (1) AUTHORITY SNAP  — drain glide, sprite at true tile+rotation.
//                  This is a RECONCILE snap (walkSnapToAuthority / #6/#9 drain),
//                  NOT a teleport: the server already walked you adjacent, so it is
//                  normally sub-tile. Believed ALREADY IMPLICIT in today's drive
//                  (glide, then play the server-told anim) — VERIFY whether it is
//                  explicit before piping; if not, the mechanism exists to pipe.
//              (2) push recorded SEQUENCE (was: bespoke EVENT_DOOR_STATE / _ACTION_ANIM)
//              ▼
//        GLUED — client replays the authoritative sequence, movement locked
//              ▼
//        RELEASE → free-roam glide again
//
//   Self-actions (weapon switch, use-on-self, sneak-toggle) are the degenerate
//   zero-approach case: empty glide segment, snap-in-place + sequence + release.
//
// THE ONE EXCEPTION (soft by design): out-of-combat tile-crossing walk/run GLIDE.
// Genuinely hard — real-time, concurrent actors, interruptible, re-pathed — and the
// least fidelity-critical (the "travel" state). It stays STATE-lane (MOVE events
// with durMs, the glide machinery, kept exactly as built); its walk-frame anim
// stays locally-derived (accepting bugs #2/#7 as forgivable travel-state cosmetics).
// The recorder's only interaction with a live free-roam walk is a SYNC_MOVE marker
// so a following recorded sequence waits out the approach glide (spec §6.1).
