// Slot INDEX SPACE — how many slots the engine can address, NOT how many the
// player sees. 0..9 (directories SLOT01..SLOT10) are the ten the vanilla load and
// save screens enumerate; 10.. are the dedicated server's AUTOSAVE ROTATION
// window (server_admin.cc kAutosaveSlot / kAutosaveKeep), deliberately past the
// end of that enumeration so an unattended save can never clobber a real one.
//
// This used to be a bare `11` — one autosave slot, overwritten in place forever.
// Every map change fires an autosave, so entering a random encounter replaced the
// only checkpoint you had with a mid-encounter transient map and there was nothing
// older to fall back to. The window is the fix; growing this constant is how you
// widen it (nothing derives a loop bound from the array, it is indexed by slot).
//
// The LAST index (15, directory SLOT16) is the QUICKSAVE slot (server_admin.cc
// kQuickSlot): F6 writes it, F7 reloads it. It sits past the autosave window, so
// the rotation never touches it, and past the manual ten, so a numbered `save`
// cannot land on it by accident.
