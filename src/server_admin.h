// ADMIN verbs for the dedicated server's control channel (F2_SERVER_CMD) —
// save, load, slot listing, world selection. Distinct from the debug verbs in
// command.cc for two concrete reasons, not as a matter of taste:
//
//   * They ANSWER. `saves` prints a listing to the operator, so they need the
//     reply sink CommandListener hands the line callback. commandDispatch has
//     no reply path — it pokes the sim and logs to the server's stderr.
//   * Their arguments are not integers. `Command` is {name, arg, arg2} ints, so
//     `save 2 before the boss fight` cannot ride it. Widening Command for one
//     caller would disturb the shared probe/server dispatch contract.
//
// Server-side only (f2_server, not f2_core): the client has screens for all of
// this and no control channel to serve.

// One deferred world-lifecycle request. `load`/`new` cannot act inline — they
// have to run between serve loops, not from inside a poll callback nested in
// one — so the verb records the intent and main() acts on it.
