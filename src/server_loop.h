// Fixed-timestep headless simulation loop (SERVER_LOOP_DESIGN.md). This is the
// keystone that decouples the sim from animation/render/frame timing and
// dissolves the four timing couplings that defeated the instant-animation
// retrofit into the frame-driven probe loop (see REWRITE_PLAN Phase 2 status).
//
// Activation is INTERLOCKED and done as a coherent whole (the pieces are
// mutually load-bearing — each partial step breaks on its own):
//   * sim_clock feeds tickersExecute (input.cc) when serverLoopActive() — sim
//     time = tick count * kServerTickDelta, no longer getTicks() call-count;
//   * NullPresenter installed (the deadlocking HUD end-button loops become
//     no-ops), InstantAnimationScheduler installed (animations drain per pump);
//   * gameMoviePlay is guarded headless (marks seen, skips playback);
//   * combat_ui's _combat_input/_combat_turn_run take the server branch
//     (auto-end-turn, pump w/o render/throttle).
// serverRun() owns installing/restoring the presenter + scheduler + clock and
// the active flag; the caller supplies the per-tick intent drain.

// True while serverRun() is executing. Read by the interlocked seams
// (input.cc clock feed, combat_ui.cc combat driver, game_movie.cc guard) to
// select server behavior; false everywhere else (the client is unaffected).
bool serverLoopActive();

// True for the whole duration of a headless probe run — BOTH the legacy
// F2_PROBE_ACTIONS pump and the F2_SERVER_LOOP tick loop (serverLoopActive() is
// the narrower subset, true only inside serverRun()). Modal UI drivers that
// have no headless backing for their window/render/real-time pacing — e.g. the
// pipboy rest loop, which would draw to a never-created window — gate that
// pacing on this so the real modal loop's SIM runs on either probe path while
// the UI is skipped. Set once at probe entry (main.cc); always false in the
// real client, so the client is unaffected.

// ►► IS A CO-OP FEATURE ENABLED? Features are ON BY DEFAULT — a normal dedicated-server
// launch should need no env vars to get combat presentation, recorded animation, smooth
// walking, live dialogue, travel or cutscenes. Those are BASIC BEHAVIOUR, not experiments,
// and requiring six opt-ins to reach a playable server was backwards (owner ruling
// 2026-07-25: "goldens should be forcing feature disabling, not server typical launch").
//
// Resolution order:
//   `F2_X=0`            -> OFF. The explicit kill switch, matching the numeric form
//                          serverActionGateEnabled() already used.
//   `F2_X=<anything>`    -> ON, explicitly.
//   unset, on a SERVER   -> ON. The point of this function.
//   unset, under the
//   HEADLESS PROBE       -> OFF. The probe is the vanilla-baseline oracle: it exists to
//                          reproduce single-player deterministically, so anything that
//                          changes sim or presentation behaviour must be opt-IN there.
//                          This is how the goldens "force disabling" — once, here, rather
//                          than as six env vars repeated across forty harness invocations.
//                          A golden that WANTS a feature still sets it explicitly.
//
// Read the result through a `static` initializer at each call site as the existing gates
// do: these are launch-time switches, never live inputs.

// ►► Use this — NOT serverLoopActive() — for rules that exist because a server
// HOSTS OTHER PLAYERS, as opposed to rules about how the sim is driven. The
// motivating case is the player-death survival rule (MP_PROPOSAL.md Ch 9): a
// dedicated server must never terminate because a player died, but the golden
// probe is not a dedicated server — it is a single-player sim harness whose
// pinned traces legitimately END when the dude dies, exactly as vanilla does.
// Gating that rule on serverLoopActive() suppressed the vanilla endgame in the
// probe too, which silently extended four combat goldens by thousands of ticks
// of post-death AI (measured: arvillag_restfight/gunfight/aimshot +
// klatoxcv_combat, the four whose dude reaches hp=0).

//       instant scheduler draining to completion, dude fidget);

// sim-ms; the player barrier TAKES (reads + clears) it at turn-begin and adds it on top
// of the flat human budget. Only non-player actions accumulate (the player's own moves/

// condition (e.g. "the game hasn't requested quit, and a safety tick cap hasn't
