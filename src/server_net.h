// f2_server socket transport (P5-C STEP 3 "MAKE IT ACCEPT", [[p5-server-plan]]).
//
// SocketByteSink is the ByteSink implementation that carries the binary wire
// (the "F2NS" stream built by the NetworkPresenter in f2_core's
// presenter_network.cc, STEP 2) over a TCP socket to connected viewer clients.
// presenter_network.h reserves this per-side transport for f2_server precisely
// because a socket in f2_core would be the wrong layer: the encoder is shared
// core policy, the transport is genuinely per-side behavior.
//
// Model: SINGLE-THREADED. server_main binds and listens, blocks until the first
// viewer connects (acceptClients), registers the sink (presenterSetServerSink),
// then streams beats. STEP 5 adds MID-STREAM JOIN: the serve loop polls
// acceptPending() each beat; a joiner gets the stream preamble immediately from
// the transport, and the loop answers with a rebaseline BROADCAST (fresh netId
// walk + blob + baseline to ALL clients — C.4: the walk resets the whole-stream
// netId domain, so a per-client blob cannot exist without netIds on the wire).
// Every client sees one identical byte stream after its preamble; there is no
// per-client framing (the client seeds its frame-seq from the first frame it
// receives). A separate accept thread + locked FIFO can be layered on later;
// the beat loop stays deterministic and lock-free.
//
// Outbound: write() broadcasts each frame to every live client and drops any
// client whose socket has died (EPIPE/ECONNRESET).
//
// Inbound (3b): pollInbound() is the non-blocking reader wired into the serve
// loop's intentsDrain slot — it recvs whatever bytes have arrived, splits them
// into newline-delimited command lines, and hands each line to a callback that
// reifies it as a Command and dispatches it (the P5-A FIFO choke point). The v1
// inbound framing is a plain text line "verb [arg] [arg2]\n" — deliberately the
// string-verb v0 the shared commandDispatch already speaks (a typed binary
// command frame replaces it once the protocol is frozen, REWRITE_PLAN 3.4).
