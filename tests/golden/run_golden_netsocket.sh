# Netsocket gate (P5-C STEP 3 "MAKE IT ACCEPT": the wire over a real TCP socket).
#
# STEP 3 adds only the TRANSPORT (src/server_net.cc SocketByteSink), not the wire
# CONTENT. So this gate does NOT re-validate reconstruction against a state dump —
# that is the netstream gate's job (run_golden_netstream.sh), via the client probe,
# which is the only binary with a state_dump oracle. f2_server has no such oracle
# ("did it abort?" is its STEP 1 oracle), so bolting one on would be a detour.
#
# ►► THE CLAIM HERE IS TRANSPORT FAITHFULNESS: the bytes a client captures off the
# socket equal the bytes the SAME serve run produced. SocketByteSink tees every
# outbound write() to a file (F2_SERVER_NET_TEE) AND to the client sockets from the
# identical buffer; capturing the socket and diffing against the tee therefore tests
# only DELIVERY — no dropped, reordered, or truncated frames. Wire CONTENT correctness
# is the netstream gate's job (client probe vs state_dump) and carries over unchanged.
#
# ►► WHY SAME-RUN, NOT TWO RUNS: an earlier two-run design (socket run vs a separate
# F2_NETSTREAM file run) conflated transport with sim determinism — and f2_server is
# NOT deterministic run-to-run on AI-heavy maps (it has no F2_FAKE_CLOCK, so wall-clock
# getTicks steers AI timing; denbus1 even reaches the still-stubbed _strmfe symbol on
# some runs and aborts). The tee removes that dependency: one run, produced-vs-delivered.
#
# Maps here must SERVE CLEANLY under f2_server (no _strmfe-class STEP-1 stub abort),
# else the run truncates and tee/socket can diverge at the tail. artemple + newr1 are
# verified clean + deterministic and span a wide stream size.
#
# ►► BYTE-IDENTITY (not prefix) is valid here because net_capture.py stays connected
# and reads to EOF: the server streams every beat up to the tick cap, THEN closes, so
# the client receives exactly what the tee logged. (If a client disconnected mid-run,
# the tee — the authoritative produced-wire log — would legitimately be a superset of
# that client's capture by the beats after it left; the gate deliberately does not
# exercise that, since it is testing delivery integrity, not disconnect behavior.)
#
# A case PASSES only when the capture succeeds AND cmp reports byte-identical.
#
