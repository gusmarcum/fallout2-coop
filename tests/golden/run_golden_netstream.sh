# Netstream gate (P5-C STEP 2 "MAKE IT TALK": the BINARY wire -> reconstructed state).
#
# Sibling of run_golden_replay.sh. That gate validates the NARRATE TEXT serialization
# of the event stream; this one validates the REAL BINARY WIRE (F2_NETSTREAM,
# src/presenter_network.cc — the encoding a socket carries in STEP 3). Both feed the
# SAME encoding-agnostic reconstructor + validator in tools/replay.py, which
# dispatches on the stream's magic ("F2NS" = binary, else narrate text).
#
# ►► THE ORACLE IS THE STATE DUMP, NOT THE OTHER SERIALIZATION (design review
# 2026-07-15). It is tempting to gate "binary reconstructs the same world as narrate"
# — that is WEAK: it only proves the two encoders agree, so a SHARED omission (both
# written from the same reading of the spec, both mis-gating suppression the same way)
# passes silently. It is translation validation, not correctness. So each case here
# validates the binary reconstruction against `state_dump`, which reads live sim state
# INDEPENDENTLY of the presenter seam — non-circular, and free. That the profiles below
# happen to equal run_golden_replay.sh's is a welcome cross-check, not the claim.
#
# Determinism (already golden-locked) is what lets the binary and text captures come
# from SEPARATE runs: presenters are one-way sinks and cannot perturb the sim, so no
# tee is needed.
#
# A case PASSES only when BOTH hold:
#   (1) replay.py exits 0 — no reconstructed position the dump contradicts, no frame
#       seq gap, no truncated/trailing bytes (the binary front-end is strict: it
#       raises on any framing violation, so a malformed wire FAILS rather than
#       silently decoding to a plausible world);
#   (2) the PROFILE line equals the pinned expected value (regression lock).
#
# Usage: tests/golden/run_golden_netstream.sh
# Env: F2_GAME_DIR (default <repo>/FO2), F2_BIN (default <repo>/build/fallout2-ce)
#
# NOTE the binary is the CLIENT PROBE, not f2_server — deliberate. presenter_network.cc
# lives in f2_core precisely so the probe (the only binary with a golden oracle: a real
# map, real scripts, a state_dump to check against) can emit and gate the wire.

# ►► THE MAP-CHANGE CASE — the one no other gate has, and the reason this file exists
# beyond encoding coverage. A mid-run transition RECYCLES every netId
# (objectAssignAllNetIds resets the counter to 1 and re-walks the new object set), so
# without the post-transition re-baseline (serverEmitBaseline, server_loop.cc) every
# netId the consumer holds silently comes to mean a DIFFERENT object — the stream does
# not go incomplete, it LIES, and NOTHING else in the suite would notice: none of the
# four cases above changes maps, and replay.py's own docstring depended on that.
# arvillag -> denbus1 (entermap:6) crosses a real exit grid.
# A/B-VERIFIED (2026-07-15, measured — not estimated): with serverEmitBaselineIfMapChanged
# suppressed, this case reports
#     matched=7 moved=6 mismatched=134 not_in_dump=1704   (UNTRACKED=1117)
# and REPLAY FAILs. With it, matched=2863 mismatched=0 not_in_dump=1 UNTRACKED=0.
# So the case has real teeth: it is the difference between a coherent world and
# near-total garbage, and it is invisible to every other gate in the suite.
# (not_in_dump was 2 before the STEP-4 objectAssignAllNetIds NO_SAVE-skip, which
# aligned the walk domain with the blob/delta domain — CLIENT_JOIN_DESIGN.md §C.
# It went 1 -> 0 when objectMoved stopped emitting MOVE for netId 0: the last
# phantom was gEgg, which objectSetLocation drags along with the dude, so the wire
# announced a ghost the reconstruction had to carry that the dump never contains.
# not_in_dump=0 is now the real invariant: everything the wire names is a real,
# dumped object.)

# ►► THE SAME-INDEX RE-ENTRY CASE — subtler than xmap and it broke the same way.
# Loading the SAME map index twice (leave and come back) tears down and rebuilds every
# object while mapGetCurrentMap() never changes, so an index-equality check misses the
# rebaseline entirely and the fresh objects keep netId 0 (objectAllocate zeroes it,
# object.cc:3444) => every object collides on 0. THIS is why the change signal is
# mapGetLoadGeneration() and not the map index (map.h).
# A/B-VERIFIED (2026-07-15, measured): keyed on the map INDEX this case reports
#     matched=2 moved=1 mismatched=0 not_in_dump=2864
# and replay.py STILL PRINTS "REPLAY OK" — its exit check is `not mismatches and
# matches`, and 2 matches with 0 mismatches passes. Only the pinned PROFILE catches it.
# That is exactly why the profile pin, not the exit code, is this gate's teeth.
