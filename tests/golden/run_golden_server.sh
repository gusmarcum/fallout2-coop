# Fixed-timestep SERVER-LOOP golden gate (SERVER_LOOP_DESIGN.md).
#
# Replays each case headlessly under F2_SERVER_LOOP=1 and diffs the state dump
# against the checked-in server golden (tests/golden/server/*.golden.txt). This
# is the second gate alongside run_golden.sh: run_golden.sh pins the LEGACY
# frame-driven probe byte-for-byte; this pins the server loop's deterministic,
# outcome-equivalent behavior. The two golden sets legitimately differ in
# timing/RNG-cadence fields (game_time, rng_state, queue timestamps, ambient
# wander, RNG damage/heal rolls) — see the equivalence review.
#
# Differences from run_golden.sh: F2_SERVER_LOOP=1; input-replay SPACE traces
# dropped (auto-end-turn); the walk trace replaced by a walkto intent. Combat
# (klatoxcv, restfight) resolves with the dude passing every turn — the same
# semantics the old SPACE traces produced. F2_FAKE_CLOCK stays set (still
# load-bearing for the wmtravel probe driver).

# Usage:
