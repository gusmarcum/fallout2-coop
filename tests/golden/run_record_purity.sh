# RECORD-PURITY gate (PRESENTATION_RECORD_REPLAY_SPEC.md).
#
# The presentation recorder runs on the DEDICATED SERVER (f2_server, the server_anim.cc
# backend): to record an animation it runs the engine's animate branch it otherwise skips
# — creating transient objects, drawing cosmetic RNG, walking reg_anim — and claims to be
# sim-neutral via an RNG snapshot/restore + transient cleanup. This gate PROVES it.
#
# DIFFERENTIAL, not baseline: each case runs f2_server twice on a DETERMINISTIC map with a
# record-exercising scenario — once with F2_SERVER_PRES_RECORD off, once on — and requires:
#   (1) the state dump byte-identical off vs on  (saveable sim state + RNG), and
#   (2) the NO_SAVE object count identical off vs on  (transient-leak check — NO_SAVE
#       objects are skipped by the dump, so a leaked explosion cloud is invisible to (1)).
# Purity == identity, so there is NO checked-in baseline and NO reblessing; adding a record
# family just adds a CASE. A divergence means record mode perturbed the sim: an unrestored
# RNG draw, a double-applied state callback, or a leaked transient.
#
# Only the RECORDING backend (f2_server) is meaningful here — the client/golden binary
# (fallout2-ce) links animation.cc, where the recorder is inert by design (see
# pres_record.h presRecordSetBackendActive).
#
# Usage: tests/golden/run_record_purity.sh

# ►► AND SO MUST THE PACING. F2_SERVER_PACE_MS is a wall-clock sleep PER TICK whose
# default belongs to live play, not to a harness: at the shipped 100 ms this case's 4000
# ticks need 400 s and the 120 s timeout below kills the run, which the loop then reports
# as "off run crashed" — a real 2026-07-27 false positive that cost an A/B bisect to
# unmask. A golden must pin every server default it cannot afford, exactly as it pins the
# recorder below.
#
# ►► THE "OFF" ARM MUST DISABLE EXPLICITLY. Features are ON by default for a server
# (server_loop.h serverFeatureEnabled) — this harness drives f2_server, not the headless
# probe, so an unset F2_SERVER_PRES_RECORD would now mean RECORD ON and both arms would be
# identical, making the gate vacuously pass. It is the GOLDEN's job to opt out.
