"""Event-stream file replayer / protocol-completeness validator (P5-C, slice 1).

The dedicated-server design (MP_PROTOCOL.md) streams authoritative world state as
a sequence of events. The NarratePresenter (F2_NARRATE) is already the first
serializer of that stream (event -> text line), so a narrate capture on disk IS a
serialized event log. This tool is the first CONSUMER of that log: it reads the
event stream back, reconstructs a world model by APPLYING each event, and checks
the reconstruction against the server's own authoritative state_dump.

That is the whole point of building the consumer as a file replayer FIRST (before
any socket): it proves the LOGICAL protocol is sufficient to reconstruct state,
decoupled from wire encoding and networking. When the socket lands (later P5-C
slice) the file source is swapped for a socket; the reconstruction logic is reused.

►► SCOPE, 2026-07-26: POSITION/PRESENCE **plus** the full syncable field set.
It reconstructed exactly (tile, elev) for a long time, and that is why a whole bug
class was invisible to every gate: a stream can be wrong about an object's proto,
art frame, flags, hp or inventory all day and still pass a position check. The
reconstructor now applies EVENT_OBJECT_DELTA field by field (it used to skip the
event whole) and can be asked to check itself:

    tools/replay.py --audit <stream>

which compares the server's own EVENT_STATE_AUDIT records — its authoritative view
of every object — against what this reconstruction produced, and exits non-zero on
any divergence. A difference there is a PROTOCOL hole, not a client bug: no viewer
can be right about a field the wire never sent. See src/state_audit.h.

SCOPE OF THE ORIGINAL SLICE — POSITION / PRESENCE reconstruction.
The world is seeded FIRST from the join baseline `snapshot` (server_loop.cc
serverInstall): one line per object present at t=0, carrying pid/tile/elev/netid.
Objects that appear only later are still seeded lazily from the first event that
reveals a position: spawn (tile) / connect (tile,elev) / a move's fromTile+fromElev.
Subsequent move/connect/disconnect/destroy update the entry. We then compare the
reconstructed world position of every tracked object against the dump. The baseline
closes the old UNTRACKED gap: objects placed before the stream began (the initial
map loads before the narrate presenter installs) or loaded silently via _obj_load_obj
(no spawn -- the item<->world load finding) are now seeded at t=0, so UNTRACKED is 0
for a case that does not change maps (the single install-time baseline covers the
whole run; a mid-run map change would need a re-snapshot -- none of the gate cases do).
A reconstructed position the dump CONTRADICTS is a hard fail (exit 1) -- the stream
lost a state change.

KEYING: the world model and the dump index are keyed by NETID (the unique server id
minted per object under the server loop; a full deterministic re-walk assigns them on
map load -- MP_PROTOCOL.md §7 / cb54952). Netids are unique within a map, so the old
obj->id collision (~53%) no longer keys anything here; pid is still carried and used
to disambiguate a NO_SAVE transient (e.g. a gore critter) from dumped scenery so it
is classified not_in_dump rather than a false hole.

WHAT THIS IS / IS NOT. This is a reconstruction REGRESSION GATE + a semantic position
check, NOT a from-scratch completeness oracle. "REPLAY OK" alone is not proof of
completeness; the GATE (run_golden_replay.sh) adds the teeth by PINNING the per-case
PROFILE line (matched/moved/mismatched/not_in_dump). With the baseline seeding every
present object, a LOST event is caught more strongly than before:
  * a lost destroy/disconnect leaves an on-map object the dump no longer attests ->
    not_in_dump grows past the pin -> FAIL;
  * a lost move leaves a BASELINE object stuck at its t=0 tile != the dump's final
    tile -> mismatched grows -> FAIL (pre-baseline such an object was silently
    untracked and invisible; now it is always tracked).
`moved` (matches with real net displacement, seed_tile != final tile) is pinned as a
meaningful coverage floor, excluding trivial same-tile self-matches. Residual leniency:
an object whose position AND presence are wrong in a way that happens to still match
some dump entry with its (netid,pid) -- bounded to near-zero by the unique netid.

Usage: replay.py <stream_file> <state_dump_file>
The stream may be either a NARRATE text capture (F2_NARRATE) or the BINARY
netstream (F2_NETSTREAM, presenter_network.cc) -- dispatched on the magic. Both
feed the same reconstructor, so the validation below is encoding-agnostic.
Prints a PROFILE line the gate pins. Exit 0 if no reconstructed position
contradicts the dump; 1 on a contradiction / parse error.
